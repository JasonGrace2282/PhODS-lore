\subsection{The Creation of ISODN}
\firstword{W}{e} start with the creation of the big parent of PhODS, ISODN. It all started, as most great things do, with a group chat. This group chat contained a many people passionate about olympiads in different fields, such as Science and Math.

It soon became obvious that a single (or even several) group chats would not be able to conveniently contain all the new members arriving constantly, and thus the shift to discord was made. The group chats each became their own server, and their respective leaders talked in a server for ISODN.\footnote{Eventually, this ISODN server became public to allow for discussions, and grievances.}
